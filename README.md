# Brain-Tumor-Detection
"Flask-based web app for brain tumor detection. Upload MRI scans, get instant results. Fast, accurate, and user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals. Powered by deep learning technology." 


**Model Training and Integration:**

Train a brain tumor detection model using a suitable deep learning architecture (e.g., U-Net, CNN).
Save the trained model weights and architecture for later use.

**Setting Up Flask App:**

Create a new directory for your Flask project.
Set up the basic structure: static/ for static files (e.g., CSS, images), templates/ for HTML templates.

**Flask Routing:**

Define routes in app.py to handle different pages of the web application (e.g., home page, result page).

**HTML Templates:**

Create HTML templates in the templates/ directory. These templates will define the structure of your web pages, including forms for uploading MRI scans.

**File Upload and Processing:**

Implement a form in your HTML template to allow users to upload MRI scans.
In the Flask route that handles form submission, process the uploaded file. This may involve saving the file, preprocessing it for model input, and passing it to the model for prediction.

**Model Inference:**

Load the pre-trained model in Flask. Use it to make predictions on the uploaded MRI scan.

**Display Results:**

Create a separate template to display the results of the tumor detection.
Styling and User Interface:

Use CSS and other front-end technologies to style your web application and make it user-friendly.

**Integration of Model Output:**

Display the model's output on the results page. This could be a binary classification (tumor or no tumor) or a segmentation result.

**Testing and Debugging:**

Thoroughly test the application, including edge cases. Use Flask's built-in debugging tools to identify and fix any issues.
Deployment:
Once your application is working locally, you can deploy it using a platform like Heroku or AWS.
Documentation and Usage Guide:
Provide clear instructions on how to use the web application, including any dependencies or setup required.
Remember to handle potential errors gracefully, such as incorrect file types or unexpected inputs. Additionally, consider adding features like user authentication and security measures to protect sensitive medical data. Finally, always respect privacy and data protection regulations when working with medical information.
